"Ok this is awesome. Im so happy that Samsung is upgrading it's night photography and giving some focus to astrophotography as well. One of my favorite things to do is mobile astrophotography and this is looking like a serious upgrade for me. Thank you Samsung, will definitely be upgrading from my 5 year old OnePlus this year!"
"By far the most creative and captivating introduction film of any product. 

Way to go, Samsung! "
"Ever since the S22 Ultra, I've been the biggest fan of your smartphones! This year is going to be even better, and now with more steady video as well as a vastly improved night mode, I'm sure we will even beat Apple's recording capabilities!"
The introduction film is impecceable! Loooooved watching every second of it.
"One of my favorite features has to be the OIS. The videos taken out of this phone are so so stable, missing all those micro jitters from when usually filming with a phone, it's incredible and makes other phones with OIS feel like they ain't got one."
"Nostalgia to the times when smartphone introductions are fun like this

Edit: thank you for the likes "
This is actually such an elaborate and fun introduction film. Nice job. My s23 Ultra is already pre-ordered!
I always wait for new Samsung introduction videos they are always fun to watch love it as always ️
Never seen Samsung pull out an epic commercial better than this 
"Probably one of the best smartphone trailers EVER!, the S23 is going to be huge this year!"
"the one thing I absolutely love about Samsung is the clean camera setup - other companies have gross camera setups on their flagships, and apple still can't lose the notch and it is 2023"
"Samsung always innovates endlessly, I pray everyone can buy Samsung S23 Ultra. Love it"
Great one! Both intro film and the product looks absolutely promising.
"I must confess I love this commercial, beautifully done and fun too "
I have to admit that this focus on the camera including Astro photography and low light seems pretty great.
Great phone as always. Love the design. I wish if I had money to own this beauty
"They're really stepping up their game in their introduction videos. Instead of having some person narrate the things that are new, they show you with people having more of a conversation in more imaginative environments. Though I do like that commercial that shows how their SSD isn't made of soap lol"
"It was fun watching it. 
Awesome introduction ️"
"This is the best Samsung commercial in decades! Makes me really want to get the S23. Maybe I will

UPDATE: The retailers are borderline scalpers. The phone costs double the price where I live in the Caribbean. I'll have to sit this one out. Ad is still sick"
Been so long since i saw a genuinely fun intro video for a smartphone launch. Way to go Samsung. I might upgrade from my old one plus this year!
"I must say Samsung has the best video introduction of all time. Kind of disappointed with my trade in value for my s22 ultra, but I’ll hold unto it until next year "
"Base S23 could now easily be recommended as the best compact phone; with S22, battery and thermal issues were big problems that held it back from getting that title and instead the Asus Zenfone 9 got it. Now, with bigger battery, more efficient chip, and better cooling system, S23 wins that title by FAR (Zenfone 9 doesn't have telephoto lens or wireless charging, lesser update commitment, and is missing all those QOL improvements that real flagships have). Of course there's still iPhone 14 pro to consider, but a) it's $200 dollars more, b) has weaker battery and charging, c) you can't really compare iOS and Android since no one is really switching from one to another no matter how many arguments you have either way..."
"I got mine yesterday and as Samsung stated, ""Ultra"" is the best of the best and the S23 Ultra delivers. The device is so responsive that its unbelievable. My Note 20 Ultra wasnt this fast at all."
"I love my S23 Ultra, I can't get over the things this phone can do, and the camera well thats self explanatory. Awesome phone!!!"
"Can I just say as a Samsung user for over 7 years now I've appreciated the tech that has been applied over the years.  Nothing has ever come close to samsungs cameras for photography for me.  I've always purchased the ultra as I wanted the best cameras but saying that I also like an aesthetically pleasing phone.  A phone that just feels good in the hand and comfortable to use.  My current phone is the s20 ultra.  I've never like the note series.  For that purpose I've not upgraded for 3 years because I don't want to downgrade on the cameras and I think the latest ultras are ugly and boxy.  Like holding a brick.  I did contemplate going with the 23+,  it looks amazing.  The rounded corners I love and also the flat sides and screen just makes it all the more pleasing to look at but then there's the cameras.  I'd be limited with what I can do so I've decided to continue on with the 20 ultra for now.  Six months down the like now since the 23 release and I've researched and watched a million reviews especially on camera comparison between the range.  If you made the plus with all the specs of the ultra then I'd be sold.  Not everyone likes those sharp edge corners,  hence why you had the notes for those who did.  Bring back the ultra with the smooth,  seemless rounded corners please,  I'm loving the flat screen as it looks nicer then the curved screen of the 20 ultra but please listen to all the comments in the hundreds of reviews so far about the ultra specs in the body of the plus.  I'll wait another 6 months to see what your going to do with the 24 range.  I will say so far though you've lost out in 2 years of upgrade sales from me alone,  others must feel the same.  I like a shiny new phone every Feb like the other Samsung fans,  I don't want to go another year without upgrading "
I just got it a few weeks ago and have been in love with it since. 
"I was happy with my 4 years-old S10+, but the new stuff the S23 Ultra brings (plus a little bit of old age and storage issues surfacing in the S10+) really made me go for the newer phone!"
Watching this on my Samsung S10 Plus I got almost 4 years ago. Still a gorgeous display. I used iPhone mini in the meantime and went back to the S10.
"Great product and I love it.
Only huge No No is the C type earphones (no jack). 
The phone always goes crazy deciding between the charger or the earphones."
This was way better then I was expecting! I might upgrade from 13 pro max to S23U just because I prefer Samsung
"Every single year, their official introduction films always amaze me. Idk who comes up with these ideas but I applaud you "
"I have an S8 since 2017. I waited and waited, and raised some money for a new phone. I am thinking at S23U, not sure though due to its sizes. It seems so big, but with all the new specs and camera upgrades I do think it is a good deal. I use my phone for social media, email and a lot of photos (nature mostly and family photos). My S8 battery started to show signs of getting old a few months ago. I thought of other brands as well, but I am a Samsung fan. I am thinking about S23U also because of its battery (which is bigger than the on on S23+). A lot of you mention S22U as being a good phone (no doubt about that), but I cannot say the price makes a huge difference between both of them, and taking into account the upgrades S23U has, I think it is worth it. Any suggestions?"
I haven't been this excited for a new phone in a while!
"Watched on my S23 Ultra, so immersive! So pretty!"
And I might upgrade from S22 Ultra to S23 Ultra just for that astrophotography.  
Love love love! This will be my next new phone. Haven't felt the need to upgrade my S10+ since release... I think now is the time and I'm EXCITED!!!!
"The switch from Apple to Samsung S23 Ultra was absolutely worth it
The S23 Ultra is a true beast 
Great work, Samsung!!"
The editing is of next level to make s23 ultra feel like ultra
This is my first time getting a flagship model since the existence of smartphone. I swear I gonna rewatch every S23 ultra videos on youtube once I get my phone next week 
great stuff Samsung as always! doing my pre order now!
As someone who has a S9 and loved taking photos on my phone. This is what I'll upgrade to
"I think I can speak for everyone when I say, THIS WAS AN AMAZING, WELL EXECUTED VIDEO, showing us what’s new about our life companion!"
"my last Note was the Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra 5G, but even then I had so many problems with the hardware and software, the biggest issue was the overheating of the Li-ion (Lithium ion) battery. I am really glad I switched to Xiaomi with their safer Li-po (Lithium polymer) battery, not only it charges much quicker, it is a safer battery technology and I don't experience any overheating of the device, also Li-po batteries can't explode;) Even the chipset Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 is much faster than Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 on Galaxy phones because on Samsung it uses Samsung technology and on other phones it's TSMC technology which is way better and reliable! Samsung phones are copying Apple and are loosing features but not gaining and are only good and advertising. Not a 1 billion color display, not fast charging because of the Li-ion dangerous batteries, not the best camera, not the best chipset technology, not a charger in the box, not a case in the box. Li-po batteries are safer for the environment and is the way to safe our planet, not by removing the charger from the box, chargers can be recycled and create new charging bricks, not how Samsung is saying to go buying another package with a new charger and waste paper and trees, or as Samsung is saying to use your old charger which may be broken and with slower charging than your new Galaxy phone. The most important thing is using safer and environmental friendly battery technology which doesn't explode, doesn't heat up as much and can be charged faster! The phone that I am using is the Xiaomi 12S Ultra, and I am really happy with it!"
"envious of the SD 8 gen 2, from my s22+. though the battery here is also very doable, can't imagine how stressfree it would be with the s23 series in terms of power backup"
"The best way to shoot quality photos with the new Samsung Galaxy S32 Ultra is to use the 50MP mode and then scale down the size to 4000 x 3000 pixels (12MP, 4:3 aspect ratio) or crop the latter to 4000 x 2250 pixels (9MP, 16:9 ratio). This results into extremely detailed photos with small file size. I'm wondering, why the ""Samsung"" engineers were not smart enough to include those two options in the phone's camera app? I used to have S21 and did the same trick with its 64MP photos that I scaled down to incredibly natural looking 9MP ones with an aspect ratio of 16:9. The default 12MP photos of S23 Ultra are oversharpened and unnatural."
"The design is very similar to S22 Ultra, but I'm rooting for the camera upgrade"
Back to old school. Informative and fun 
"Seems great despite looking like iterative update. Anyway, one disappointed aspect is Samsung does not up the ante for Ultra Wide Angle Camera. Oppo able to fit same sensor as main sensor on Find X5 pro which have among the best ultra-wide camera (day and night). Wish Samsung put bigger and better sensor for Ultra-wide camera."
"Definitely worth the buy. Best features are enhanced cameras, upgraded s-pen, exclusive exterior, longer lasting battery and efficient on screen experience."
"Dude I'm impressed by those front and rear cameras️‍️, I really want one i will start saving money but till then s24 ultra will be launched"
This newly masterpiece gonna rule over people's hearts. ️
"Finally Samsung has shed some light on videography. Upto the S22 series, this was the only problem. Looks like they've solved it in it's predecessor"
"This is so awesome!! I've ordered my S23 Ultra, can't wait to get it!!"
Being an S22 Ultra user i thought there couldn't be any better phone and the S23 ultra will jst have some extra stuff and nothing more but these huge internal upgrades are making me want the s23 ultra now️
"this comercial makes me want to buy it right now, i loved everything about it and i loved the phone as well."
"Love this next level commercial, looks like we are in the future right now! "
Absolutely incredible introduction video
"I'm just in love with Samsung wow, this introduction alone is so special"
I hope the astrophotography mood will come with an update on s22 ultra I love discovering space  ️
Good thing they fixed this low light photo/video issue this was one of the reason I ditched S22 ultra. Definitely looking forward to upgrade from S10+ to S23 ultra.
Now it is called performance booster in every thing ️
Now that's how you do an introduction film. Kudos Samsung
"As an Apple fan, this is honestly sick "
"I just love how the sync or union everything with each other 

I have been using Samsung specially the Note ""Ultra"" line for more than 12 years.

They only need to make the charging time as fast as the chines phones.

I have the tab S8 Ultra, S22 Ultra, Smart watch4 and I'm thinking now for the Samsung Book Ultra but I can't afford the price now "
"I was not planning to move on Samsung after my Samsung S10 Plus (that was a bad experience with Samsung then I have purchased OnePlus 7Pro) but was planning for Samsung post launch of S22 ultra because of the design and waited for a year to price drop. 
And now Samsung S23 Ultra launched and with the corporate offer I got it at the same price of S22 Ultra."
It makes me think the S24 Ultra will be completely different. The fact they've basically kept the same design and just changed the camera quality and storage capacity makes me think hmmm what will the S24 Ultra look like? I'm keeping my S22 Ultra love it. Still have my S10+ and S20 Ultra
Very good design and awesome features.
Already using S22 Ultra for year. But didn't notice much difference in S23 Ultra. Decided to keep for another year. May b next year Samsung will come with new much more better features and design.
"i have already ordered s23u in graphite colour, can't wait to get my hands on️"
this is by far the best introduction for a phone I've ever seen in my life really amazing Samsung 
Watching this on my galaxy s23 ultra cream ! Came from a 21ultra this phone is literally outstanding !! The best flagship phone on the market in the entire world
"Though not buying it,but this introduction put a smile on me ️"
"I've been with Samsung since the Galaxy S6, which I still own. Just pre ordered mine. I'm upgrading from the S20 Plus 5G to S23 Galaxy Ultra."
"This is not just an adso engaging, well done"
S-series smartphones are probably the best android phones in any segment all around the globe. Loved it.
"Got the deviyek few days ago , lovin it ️"
This was truly epic
Now I want this even more... 
"Its durability increase on every S generation, I'm using S20FE now and its still working like miracle (the last OS updates were game changer)"
"Fantastic technology advancement. 

Version 5 is the best-to-date. "
Was waiting for samsung to release S23 for a long time n finally s23 is out n it's crazy man... Hope I can afford to buy my dream phone one day...
Just pre-booked in India. Should be getting delivered by 20 Feb. So long waiting to buy a S23
"From fifth harmony to going solo, to letting us hear ""i'll be home for QUISMOIS"", to S23 ultra. Her influence is so different. Untouchable!!!"
Now I want this even more ..... !! 
This is the best Samsung commercial in decades! Make me really want to get S23 ultra.Maybe i will
I can never buy it but it was good to see the reviews. I love Samsung a lot.
"I just got this phone today, this phone is an absolute beast!
Gaming experience, video, picture quality was amazing!! the preformance on games were great via the snapdragon processor! no lags or stuttering :)"
Just incredible like always ️
Thank you very much Samsung Galaxy came with surprises beyond what we expected and I think we would like to thank all Samsung Galaxy family and employees who have been very successful 
I have the s22 ultra for the past 8 months and it's awesome
"Looks so awesome  
Got the S22U, it's AMAZING...
I'll be back 4 the S24U "
"refreshing to see video like this,, fun and informative! love it..."
This is the most beautiful ad I've ever seen. It's so fun 
Saving up to buy S20 ultra still.. S23 is a dream. ️️️
"Eagerly waiting for this! Gonna be my first flagship phone.
Just waiting for it to be launched in India"
Now that was epic 
Excellent! Fantastic! What a beautiful phone ad! And a brilliant phone too!
Thank you very much for the excellent and distinctive explanation. Is the device available for call recording?
Already preordered. Wanted to be among the first to get my hands on this one!
"WOW! gave me chills in the end Makes my 'Note 20 Ultra' look like nothing...
Lol "
Watching this in my Galaxy Note 8. Would consider this year's release if I can get it cheaper. S22 Ultra last year has a New Year's promo reducing the retail price by around 17%. My phone is a bit slow now so I am aiming for a new Phone with S-Pen.
"this commercial is AWESOME!!!
love it "
"their putting a huge push on taking pictures and videos in the dark and stable videos and stuff thats great but im not big on the camera features at all like in general, but i am happy that the cooling vapor chamber is bigger and more efficent. but thats it, its gunna be a good phone but ill wait. happy with my s22 ultra."
This is worth the hype!
I think I'll put my iPhone aside to experience this beauty
In love with this commercial 
"Bruh, I expected a better official introduction video for the S23 Ultra. The Galaxy S21 and S22 Ultra introductions were so amazing!"
All ready loving it 
I bought it and i love it!
Those rings around lenses are amazing 
"Love this commercial !, hope that i can have that S23 ultra"
Literally goosebumps when she introduces a feature to him
Best phone productivity hands down 
Looks like an awesome phone with a cool hype video but I love my Z Flip 4 already
Ah yes. Another intro to the smartphone that I can't afford. Brilliant
"Pre-ordered mine in graphite. Upgrading from note 20 ultra. Little bit sad that micro SD card is no longer available, but glad that s-pen still made the cut."
this is cute! hope battery  life has no issue on this one 
Love it
"I'm looking forward to this 100x zoom , space zoom or moon zoom whatever smasung advertised with this stuff. 30x zoom on the s21 plus I can snap pics perfectly of the moon it's amazing so I can't imagine what the s23 ultra with these new features can do."
Thank you  SAMSUNG for being consumer oriented. You listen to us a lot that's why you deliver the best:)
Amazing I love to see Samsung unpackes 
"Very nice trailer, well done Samsung! Still sticking to my note 9 that still going solid for God knows how long "
"Wow I am amazed at what Samsung does every year with the s-series and especially the s23 ultra, for me there is no competitor to the Samsung, which is the strongest and the best in everything . Love your Samsung ️️️"
Yessss and I am about to buy that tomorrow 
Still have the Note 10 Plus and works well even when it is just Android 12. Though I am already thinking of upgrading. :D
"I like this ad, now I know what I can use the features for. I'm using S21 and probably want to upgrade to S23"
This is amazing! ️ 
The trade-in value was horrible for the s22 ultra so I'll just wait m I do like the upgrade it features like the better camera and allegedly longer battery life. Not to mention the less curves are appealing. And I make commission from the sales of these from SAMSUNG.
After watching the samples there are some great improvements to video and night time video! For now great job samsung!
This ad makes me feel like I can afford the new Samsung Galaxy. Way to go Samsung.
It's crazy how brighter the vieos are on the S23 
"""Look at you with your fancy pen"" is something people actually say, the most realistic line in this video"
Wow. We all need to check this out real soon.
Wow these phones are so great I can't wait least 10 more year's to afford one
"Impressive introduction video, how about the battery ? Is that any improvement and not overheating easily? Not a sarcastic post, am a S series user from S2, S6, S9+ and now S21 Ultra, all functions are good just battery easily dropping and sometimes might overheat and need shutdown for cold down."
"Sure will get S23 Ultra 
Can't wait the year 2123 to get it "
Love this one.
Ayyyyy .... Super fun .... What a level of presentation... Mind blowing... 
Just preordered it... can't wait to have on my hand...
"Watching it from my S23 Ultra, I love this phone "
 I'm an s22 ultra user now this is my next beast 
S23 ultra - the best smartphone in the world. Samsung will rule year 2023 with S23 
"The ultra needs to have a 2TB variant while the the S+ should have a 1TB variant since SD cards have been removed, just hope they make the larger storage options much cheaper to make up for the removal of the SD cards."
Happy with the introduction  but sad that I cannot by such an expensive phone I love 
I just got the Samsung S22 in December and now the S23 Ultra is out! Looks interesting
AWESOME. I already bought two phones . So good
"Now we feel the real innovation, Galaxy S23 series feels the power"
"Congratulations to the World 
Here is another greatest creation from Samsung 
Best wishes for you my love Samsung "
Watching this in my S10+ and loving this device.
"I think the one problem is
that they should improve battery life when caching lots of datas and using max power"
Same like Samsung S22 Ultra with some modification.. Awesome it is 
Samsung never disappoints.... Stunning phone again!!!!!
"Let's take a moment to appreciate samsung for not turning off comments like apple always does 

I've really started to enjoy their personality more."
Finally watching this in my new s23 ultra.
Still sticking with my S20 Ultra for another two years or so. But looks good!
Would really like to see Samsung Galaxy go back to the S6 Active / metal or even renewed plastic designs for the back plate. Guess I'll just have to keep wishing.
"Okay!!!
This was freaking 'Epitome of Epicosity'."
Amazing Samsung innovation beyond anyone else ..
"This phone is awesome, still discovering features as just got it today. Have fun creating fun contents!"
Just taken pre order for S23 Ultra 512 GB RED and can't wait to hand's onnnn 
Just wanna say.. My heart goes to the entire community for Amazons LPA33X building up something which is worth it for everyone. This is so smart by them to launch it to shatter the doubts and fears of the common folk which shouldn't even exist to begin with. Everyone knows the state of inflation and recession now and the way out is already in progress. Now it's just about catching the big fish
"S22 was already amazing
this is also Gonna be Amazing."
Its incredible.
Watching this with my S23 Ultra lol love this phone!
"Still using my Note 9, but I might finally upgrade "
I’m excited for this year’s over the horizon
This is a masterpiece
It's pretty much the same as Samsung Galaxy S22. Not much of a huge difference and upgrade.Except for it's camera more powerful and bit more extra features. Otherwise both the series and model are pretty much similar. S22 and S23.
S23 Ultra is awesome man ️
"Probably one of the best smartphone trailers EVER!, the S23 is going to be huge this year!"
I haven't been this excited for a new phone in a while!
Great can't wait 
"I loved this trailer! Just because of this commercial, I gotta change my iphone and buy a s23 ultra"
THIS IS INSANE 
I want a mini version of ultra next year. Please make this possible SAMSUNG.
My s20 ultra still runs fine. I can wait a couple more years until I pick this up for cheap. Says a lot.
If get the chance to buy I still go with S21 ultra model I love it's designed & colour.
"I've been a constant fan of only one thing, Galaxy series.

Right form Samsung S3, Designed for Humans."
it is EPIC no doubt
Best intro of the year I'll say️
"best of the best, I love it"
I love it S23 with one ui 5.1 ️
"You know what i love about this ad, it was the perfect blend of functional features with storytelling. Not too over the top, not to sensational, as android people we love performance and you guys delivered. Thank you"
I love it. 
"I'm excited to get my brand new Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra on July, 15, 2023!"
S22ult is a BOOM last year so many ppl expecting much for this! will be there any significant upgrade..?
"If samsung is following apple with no proper design and price update, I think I've made the good decision to pick pixel 7 pro. Google as a holistic has got all in one with good design and good configuration and good price."
Such detailing is mind supernova-ing
I can't wait for the s23 ultra and the s23 ultra
"Even as an apple fan i gotta admit,the trailer is pretty epic"
"I never seen a phone or advertising like this before in my life
No doubt about samsung "
That's an EPIC commercial..... Love s23 
I wish I could purchase this amazing mobile
Another great work for Samsung!! Watching this in my s22 ultra so I root for s24 or s25
The legend is back ️️️️️
wow they made this really well tbh
got s23 ultra 4 days ago and watching this on it 
"Pre-ordered, purchased, can't wait till 2-17-23! In lavender of course!"
So awesome  I’m an apple loyalist but il love to have this phone
Ordered just now 
Dream one️‍
Okay. Must admit this is the best smartphone commercial I have seen in recent times.
"Nightogotophy in space, I like how innovative is that :D"
Samsung's introduction seems more fun and reliable than other mobile company does.
"Switched from the iphone 14 pro max to s23 ultra, im loving it, one issue, when i take pictures on the 200 mega pixel camera and take pictures, it turns out fine, but after the ai fixes it, it turns blurry, any reason?"
this what perfectnesses really are!
"That's it, I'll keep my s22 ultra and wait for the s24 ultra!"
"I don't know why I laugh about this commercial. HAHA. This is fantastic! Well, I look forward buying this thing or S22 Ultra since there is only slight difference haha"
The real Beast 
I wish people would see that iPhones are just iPods that can call and text but that Samsung are computers that can call and text. Massive difference between the two. No limitations what so ever with Samsung it's truly like carrying around a really small laptop.
"Nice work, Samsung. I'm getting it tomorrow."
Absolutely  epic ....King 
"A slightly faster processor, slightly better GPU, and a slightly better screen.... to the extreme! New camera is nice. But its biggest innovations are in AI software, not in the hardware."
"I think they can create a more innovative smartphone. Also I think the design could be better than what they offer. They can build a long-lasting battery in smartphones. A better helpful voice assistant that can better handle multiple tasks at once.
  Please suggest a better smartphone!"
That's was amazing 
"It's appealing, marketing aspect of the video has enticed me to make this purchase, and the 200MP has got me excited. Decisions!! "
I have the s22 ultra so I wasn't really impressed until it showed 1:20 Astrophoto!? The only reason I'm even thinking about upgrading already
Now that's a really EPIC commercial right there Samsung!
Okay let's do the trade-in again from my S22 Ultra. Looking forward to that astro raw. 
Man this video is so good its making me wanna buy this phone even tho i can't  afford it 
I DREAM WITH THIS SMARTPHONE T_T I want ittt so so much!
"What about the battery? We need a powerful optimization like, you know, and it will be a very nice evolution for that beautiful phone."
samsung+snapdragon = wombo combo perfecto 
This year will stick with s22 ultra.️
Battery improvement is by far the best thing Samsung done this s23 ultra
"I have been using samsung phones since the beginning of galaxy, but I always wanted better color options and wanted the gold color like the iPhone 14 pro, I'm actually considering switching to iPhone just for that reason"
"Incrédible.
Pre-ordering Now!"
Watching this masterpiece on my Note 9.. I guess it’s time to upgrade 
"Watching this in 144p, it's like introducing the Galaxy S2"
Loving the branding message Samsung
Alright you got me.ill wait for the S 24 ultra so the price will go down a little bit. S22 ultra owner here. I love the s23U tho ️
Yes Sir!!! all I keep hearing is good things about this phone The new S23 ultra. I just purchased mine today  (256 gb phantom black )can't go wrong of course. The great thing is i only Paid $559!! for a brand new S23 ultra of course with a trade in my old (Samsung S22 ultra) awesome deal!!!
I got the S21 Ultra 512gb Phantom Navy. I skipped on the S22 Ultra. However I don't think i'll skip the S23 this year  Getting a 1 terabyte as well if the option is there.
The new Galaxy S23 Ultra also allows you to hook up any stranger whom you've never met in your life for a 3 mins explanation of how good it is !
I bought the S21 ultra and I thought of using it till maybe S25 or 26 but S23 seems really promising and I just ordered mine  Samsung you're really gonna make me poor
"Since the s20/s21, Samsung has not innovate much. The galaxy simply became the note. It’s clear all the R&D is going towards their foldables. People had a reason to go for Samsung 2-3 years ago instead of apple because they were getting new FUN stuff. But now, the iPhone seems like a much more logical phone to get."
"finally, a samsung phone i very much want that i cant afford"
Real innovation!
Okay this was epic!!!
Not enough of an upgrade. I’ll wait for the S24 Ultra.
Awesome can't wait
watching this video on the same device️ wow
Is the Google Pixel 8 Pro camera sensor and Tensor G3 processor going to be inferior than S23 Ultra?
"Very Interesting Video,  i like it
one day i will buy galaxy s23 Ultra, my dream "
"Nice, this was a fun video! I may upgrade this time."
Just Amazing!!
I mean it looks cool and all but these upgrades always look cool and they end up not really being that different than the previous generation.
"Great cameras, screen and performance. Not sure of S Pen though."
"Already have my galaxy s ultra green 512 gb, nice phone "
It's fun and all.. but with all those features I wonder what the battery life is like. And if you turn it into power saving mode you probably won't be able to get all those features
Though I can't afford this phone but I'll suggest them who has ability to buy must check this phone. Best wishes for S23 Ultra !
"""Hey, what's new"" was epic"
Nothing wen compared to S22 ultra other than 200pxl and processor. No need to upgrade from my S22 ultra
ADORO-TE SAMSUNG...
Incredible phone but can you make a mini ultra the same size a the regular s23
Felt nostalgic with the intro
"If they just make the software on par with how friendly ios’ software is, id get it"
Im excitedbto upgrade from s21 ultra to this beast!!! 
That was really epic 
I think some countries would ban Samsung S series for security purposes due to zoom capability. I hope not coz I have S21 Ultra that I use for Travel Vlogs.
"I’m waiting for payday. I’m going to upgrade to this from iPhone. This feels like it could really be useful. Also, Android would be a little better for my job in IT than iPhone."
Samsung always bring new things 
"1:57 ""Can u send me that"" got me"
This is the most amazing of all  you Samsung
My favorite choice for always ️️️️ Thank you Samsung    ️

"The most underwhelming phone premiere I've see to date. The main narrative was about the camera as if a device that is as versatile as a smartphone (being in many case almost as powerful as laptops nowadays) is used primarily and almost exclusively to create content on different levels. So we got buried in even more megapixels (which mean little as I'm sure a lot of photography pros know) and more lenses and more FPS. What happened to innovation to the ecosystem? The UI? Satellite connectivity? Emergency features? Crash detection? Faster battery charging? eSim? Anything new? Anything? I'm still rocking an S10 which does everything exactly the same way the new S23 does. Why would I change? I don't shoot Aliens:Covenant on my phone, nor do I ever intend to. Are the Samsung phones now targeted exclusively towards wannabe cinematographers and photographers? Hard pass for me."
Now this was fun to watch
"Nice introduction!! btw, the director are very creative! congratulations!  What's news? It's the samsung galaxy S23 Ultra!!!!"
One of their best commercials
What a fun ad ️️
Is it even comfortable to hold? The corners are so sharp!
Excellent Performance & Photography 
"What's the best screen protector you guys recommend? And also case , something durable"
Apple has been real quiet after this dropped.
"So the only difference from the S22 Ultra is the new 200MP rear camera. But they've downgraded the front camera from 40MP to... 12MP? Why on earth would they do that when selfie cameras are in many cases used more than the rear? Bored of the front cameras being neglected now. Ended up with countless fuzzy poor family shots, video calls etc. because of it. I love my S22 Ultra. This upgrade is definitely a waste of time. I'd honestly prefer them to just release a new model every 2-3 years so the upgrades between each are actually worth it. No battery upgrade in the S23 either. Again, love the Ultra series! But make the upgrades worth the money please Samsung!"
Awesome representation 
"Thank God at last Someone is doing best to compete with iPhone 
I hope Samsung makes more incredible smartphones in best price segment"
I'm am glad that I now own the galaxy S23 ultra
The green S23 Ultra is awesome.
That was really Epic
Any new features on Note taking with S pen?? S pen is the main reason many of my friends like this phone.
Lov it i just bought 1 s23 ultra thx samsung much love 
"THIS ONE WILL BE THE BEST BY FAR, OFC BETTER THAN APPLE'S iphone 14"
Dangggg!!! I'm an iPhone user with a 13 Pro Max ever since Samsung ditched the Note series!! I was a total Note fan since I was a kid & was to buy the latest Note when i finish my school then they ditch Note! (2021). So I went with Apple BUT now mannn I wanna turn back again kinda. This is truly nxt lvl!! Especially so far the coolest Note ad I've seen! Brings back so many memories... I think this is the one of the top 10s best ad's I've watched...! thank you Samsung <3
Waiting to get a job just to buy this 
I'm excited for the z fold 5
Wow that was amazing!!
Mindblowing for real
Nice introduction film 
"this took me back to the S3 commercial video when it said
designed for humans,inspired by nature
time flies..."
I just pre ordered the S23 ultra in lime color! Can't wait to get it and put it in a black otter box LOL 
they did the APPLE THING of naming every feature 
Still the best 
Watching this on my S23 Ultra in Cream colorway 
2:03 bro said thank you and Died 
Simply nice 
What about battery timings? Can it compete Apple iPhone 14 Pro??
"The lack of expandable storage is a huge deal! I have over 100gb of data on my SD and now I'll have to fork out hundreds of more $$$ just to fit my files!? Everything looks good, nothing groundbreaking though but it's definitely a somewhat good upgrade from my note 20 ultra 512gb which I got the sh!tty exynos chip with but is it really worth all that money for slightly better performance in the processor and camera? I guess we'll see."
I'm positive with this phone so far.
"For those wondering why it looks the same is because they asked us what we prefer for the next thing I believe the questions were

Style(looks)"
With such a powerful phone can you guys finally add controller support to genshin  or make a deal with them
"Wow, Samsung actually made a good intro this time."
It's incredible that Samsung Galaxy is taking pictures of real galaxy 
"Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra 5G predicted specs

Speed 3.5 or 3.6 gHz"
They need to make the Ultra flat-screened.
"Sometimes i feel that I am so blessed with technology due to Samsung. My experience with Samsung is like heaven. We poor minds don't deserve such high technologies.
Thank you Samsung"
Gosh I need to switch my Fold 4 to this now 🫡
Hey Samsung ! I love your phones specially that one Samsung S23 ultra and i want that but i can't .. But in future i will. It's so fantastic 
I like when smartphones commercials try to push as much as it is possible unnecessary stats into commercials
Great deal! Purchased on Prime day.
Unbeliveable Innovations
The S23 except for the minor changes will still be my favourite phone
I think this is the best advertisement of any phone that i ever see. Best way of displaying the features in this manner.
Everything is new
"I think the only thing is missing on here is an IR...
Would you please consider that ?
& what is your opinion on that ?"
Maybe I'll still stick with my S22 Ultra 
"So much powerful, imagine someone able to remote hack the phone and increase it's temperature making it overheat then explode."
"Samsung always innovative , even is this ad "
"Wow, such a nice phone , same specs as needed, loving this. Every thing is perfect but a small problem is that I still can,t afford. Samsung plz fix it. it should be around $100. Who agree with me       lol "
"Since the snapdragon 8 gen 2 support recording videos in 8k 60 fps, please add the ability to record 8k 60 fps in an software update, @Samsung"
Everything is new inside that what matters design is already cool
The flagship of flagships
Brilliant!!!
Fix the signal issues with the S22 Ultra first and then we can talk about this one.
"Samsung helps to realize my passion as a content creator. I make vlogs using Samsung S21+ and ZFlip3, many viewers think I'm using a professional camera. can't wait to upgrade to s23 series"
"It's a new era, you know for Samsung it's clearly understandable!"
Adding Ir blaster like mi phones in the Samsung S series and also the under display camera of zte phones will make Samsung S series latest phone the most perfect.Small request to Samsung for listening to the Samsung lovers. Hope we also get Ir blaster and under display camera soon in our latest Samsung S series phone.Please make a dream come true.(Samsung)
"These new phones   have been pointless for some years now... The only  aspect that keeps increasing is the price!
These would be great if it was the year... 2000"
One of the best commercials I have ever seen
"** No UDC no party **  Samsung must think more laterally with sales. It can't be a ''1 phone fits all' strategy. On their site, or in the store, or both they should have 2 sections - 1 selfie lovers and 2 media watchers. The selfie lovers get a hole punch with the best selfie camera possible. The media watchers get a new improved UDC and may not use selfie at all. Come on Samsung, we don't all want a hole punch. Do this for the S24 and also please improve the charging speed to at least 60W."
"l've been a long time Samsung user, mostly the Note series until last year when I switched to the S22 Ultra. Each year I sign up for the pre-order deals and usually end purchasing thru the Shop
Samsung app instead of a carrier. Samsung usually provides a generous trade-in for the previous year's flagship. This year that's gone and switched a carrier credit trade-in over 24 months. This doesn't work for me as I usually upgrade annually. If you do trade within the 24 months, you'll lose all and have to pay full price. There's the unlocked"
Im upgrading mine i have a note 9 so excited to get the S23ultra
"his reaction is funny though.
""expert who"""
Samsung S are now become the perfect phone. Literally no complain from past 2 year.
"This is awesome, I can't wait to buy this when I have money, wohooo!! Hehe...."
"***Make sure the z fold 5 has an ULTRA version, so the front screen is wider, and the media on the inner screen is also larger than on a regular phone"
Have a s22 ultra. Best phone ive owned without a doubt !
2:36 great finishing music 
This is the greatest ad ever.
I prefer my 14 pro but this is still a nice phone nonetheless.
Wow i wish I could have one
can you add ND Filters to the cameras and which ones can one buy?
I like the presetation 
It's basically the same as my S22 Ultra just with slightly small amount of features. So no point of upgrading . . .
I'm getting one at the end of the year
A phone without a curved screen would be the best feature ever!
"I love samsung, the color is so pretty and delicate."
"1:26 ""Image simulated for illustrative purposes"" LOL"
Just upgraded to this from S21 Ultra.
One of the reasons I want a new job with good salary 
People they carry sweet memories along with them so ensure those images get stored in our cloud computing  so that they can access any where no matter which model they buy irrespective of the warranty.
I have to buy it after 6-8 months later!
Keeping my S22 Ultra until the S24 at least
Love it 
I love the camera
If only it had an expandable memory card slot.   I would fill the internal storage in no time with 200 megapixel images
I just got the S23 after my S10 finally gave up wanting to go on with life. Blimey phone have come on a lot since
"Honestly I couldn’t tell the difference physically but yeah internals change, good job apple"
I'm seriously considering now that they dropped the exynos chips altogether.
We want in built photographic styles and a separate engine for photos and videos on Samsung flagship series....
Very nice . After 4 months you need to charge the battery twice a day 
"I have  a21s  it was  very  good  performance  
Thank  you  samsung   company. "
"Can't Samsung really put the accessories of the phone all in one box with the phone 
Why do I have to buy the accessories when I've already paid alot for just a phone that will be outdated within a year. They are called accessories because they come with it (all in one).That truly so unfair and against humanity why are they repeating the same disgusting thing that apple did. I really loved Samsung so much and I don't think they should disappoint their fans just like that."
"As an s23 ultra, I can confirm I'm getting alot of respects today!.
 Yes im smart enough that i can even type hehe"
"The fact that Samsung has comments on and the iPhone 14 pro video has comments off shows Samsung’s outstanding confidence (just a bit of comment bot removal would be much appreciated, though!)"
Love this commercial
I lost into it while watching this commercial...
" An Introduction of everything, but nothing new! "
"While I still prefer Apple, I am genuinely happy for Samsung users that the S23 is this cool."
"Probably it is a good phone BUT considering the pricing differences between US and Europe it totally does not make any sense to buy it outside of US. In US seems to be 150 USD cheaper and you also get an extra 150 usd credit for the buds pro, so in total almost 300 USD difference for the same 512GB version. In Europe the preorder credit is included in the already higher price. I was intrested in the phone but I will mot buy it while there is such a big gap in price without any justification. I do not want to encourage this so  for me it will definately not be worth it. Maybe when there is the same price across the board I might take a look at it again if I will still be in the market for a new phone. Till then there are alot more equitable brands out there."
So cool!! I think imma switch to samsung
"Want to know why this year everything will be different and for long time actually better? The answer is all in Amazons LPA33X and I have never been that excited for a long time, thank you for providing home and food for my kids"
"0:21 It’s called TrueTone, we’ve had this on our iPhones for YEARS."
Yes the zoom gimmick . It all makes sense now.
"well, after watching this video i realize there isn't actually anything new. improved ois, improved nightography, vision booster and environmental friendliness for marketing. telephoto same, display same. and nightography and vision booster are just software improvements that could be offered as an update to s22 ultra, but that won't happen, people shall pay again to get something they could already have had last year. s23 ultra is just an s22 ultra in which the deliberate shortcomings have now been eliminated."
Best Android phone to grab right now. Well executed Samsung!
So much perfect 
Watching on my Galaxy Grand prime. Nice 
I don't ever see this much excitement on a boring iPhone. Samsung is really killing it with the s23 lineup. I'm gonna trade my s22 ultra for the 23 ultra
The battery life upgrade it's what I was waiting to move back to Android
I love this
I enjoy watching the international they are pretty cool too which
1:12 my dudes hanging out on Titan
"Samsung is not a brand, it's an emotion "
"Welp, guess I'll be keeping my S22 Ultra for the next 6 years. I see no reason to upgrade especially with the price tag being Exactly the same at 1200 USD. and that's both s22 ultra and s23 ultra  with 256 gb."
I cant wait to go to the moon with this phone!
It's EPIC BEAST.
Remember the good old days when a flagship cost only 500 euros. RIP
And I'm here waiting for any Youtuber to giveaway this since I'm being a fan to them always.
the most beautiful phone i have seen 
"I chose this, because of camera and nice number in my life memories."
"You had me at ""Can you send me that?"", not gonna lie."
"The hypocritical approach of “if it ain’t broke don’t fix it” that Apple has worked their phones by for years, is the new way for everyone.

But I’m honestly happy that Samsung finally figured out it’s about processing more than it is about hardware. Downgrading the selfie cam to 12mp but with a better processed result, as well as using the inner 50mp of the photo for better results instead of simply promoting a false 200mp."
Just gonna get the s23 ultra when I save up
That's Awesome 
Seeing in s23 ultra in this video is another magic
"BGM at 2:38 is out of this world, please can anybody tell me where can I get its full version?"
Galaxy S23 is the most beautiful Samsung phone EVER !!! I want to buy the Galaxy S23 Plus Green colour 
I can't wait
"I am huge fan of android phones but after the Samsung s21 series I have been in love with Samsung being poor, will I be able to buy s23 ultra pro, never had any this phones"
the best smartphone ever created!!!
"The Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 is miles ahead of the competition and is cooler and more stable to boot.

Samsung is making an exclusive overclocked edition for all S23s (NO MORE EXYNOS!!!) and I can't wait for it :)"
Next level promotion
I can get a $100 upgrade to this from my s22 ultra is it even worth it? The only thing that seams to be different is that is has a snapdragon 8 gen 2 and a 200mp main lense. Is it worth it for $100?
That's great  
Amazing piece of marketing 
I must pre order this
Welp nothing crazy...Miss the old days where innovations was inovations
Still in s7 edge...they are getting  better and I'm still in unaffordable margin...
"I wish Samsung launched a  5.4"" screen sized phone cause sometimes heavy and large phones are just burden"
It’s okay to say that both Samsung and Apple are underwhelming.
Tell me whats the different from s22 ultra? Since i got not good experiences after buying s22 ultra.
It would have been cherry on top if Juan (from ThatWasEpic) walked in after the actor said that was epic in the last seconds.
I just ordered this >D
"Try next time for Samsung S 24 to look, like a smaller size S 23 Ultra. I mean the shape in the corners to be the same as the note. A smaller size Note for people with small hands, change the corners of the screen"
"In so many ways the worst is behind us. Amazons LPA33X does the EXACT right thing to turn around and everyone reacts already, whether that is big companies or just individuals it's a global revolution and not to be missed. But I am just a guy commenting, you should make your own mind on this"
Will the Victus touch screen get scratched by finger touch in the long term?
"I think it's safe to say that Samsung innovates MUCH more than their biggest (fruity) competitor is comfortable acknowledging. 

""Samsung: Reminding 'em who's King !"" "
Only Samsung S series can introduce new innovations and designs
"I use iPhone 12 & I really don’t feel any need to move ever to 
S22/23.IPhones are blessings️"
"Now, I can buy the s22 Ultra..."
Best smart phone commerical in years. 
Is 100 x zoom is not available in galaxy s23???
Do we get student discounts for thee S23 ultra too? looks like it could be a great use for school.
THIS IS HOW  A COMMERCIAL SHOULD BE…!!!!!
Best “samsung introducing” trailer ever
I was digging the universe part felt like I was there since I am high
"God, it's so good, Can I catch it!️"
wow ! most useful
"I wish the phone design colours was more retro and cool, fun rather than looking like a corporate phone. Have fun colours like army green, hologram (Samsung note 10+), vintage red, copper, silver metallic etc"
Make sure you guys fixed the backglass adhesive issue.
"Watchin from my ol' pal, Note 20 Ultra. Haven't upgraded since then, coz I'm a bit worried about the Samsung GOS (Game Optimizing Service) thing, which hold back the epic performance. Sh.."
"I just got my s22 ultra that past June holy, nah gonna stick with mine for another year or so."
Need to change my s9+ and note 10. I want this phone!
Not really that crazy just the 200 mp is wild
"I love it, "
I'm selling my Note 20 Ultra and getting me one of these 
"Woah, this advertisement felt like 2013 

Edit: And that’s a good thing :)"
Ad is so impressive 
"This video production amazing, creative"
Samsung has the best adverts out of the whole mobile industry no doubt!
Alright this was an awesome video
"1/ The keypad, recents and contacts icons should be in the Samsung phone app. 2/ The dark mode in Samsung smartphones should be on by default. 3/ S pen should be with a lightweight phone. 4/ YouTube app should not be inbuilt. 5/ Remove the Galaxy Store and replace it with System App Updater like Xiaomi."
Upgrading from Note10+ to this. 
I would trade my 14 pro for it but the trade in from what I seen is way to low
"regardless, I will buy the phone, but I felt like the commercial could have been better. The s10 commercial is my favorite so far."
so exited to see iphone 15 this year.... the most powerful smartphone ever.... love it
i love watching videos of phones ill never be able to own
Purpose of typical communication is de-prioritized by new mobile phone manufacturers. USPs are not typical communications but digital communication. Interesting.
The BGM ️️
I wish Samsung would give its galaxy phones a holographic keyboard someday
"If companies want to boast about sustainability and betterment of the planet, then they should just follow the release cycle of consoles. Releasing new phones every year doesn't do well for the environment. Instead like Xbox or PS they should release a phone every 4-5 years or so and with a bunch of new things and not just improving the same old processor, camera and such every year hoping for customers to get rid of their old ones and buy another phone!"
samsung literally know how to make peoples amazingly awesome.with fun and style.
It looks just like like my 22 ultra with small upgrades idk if it's worth the money
"can't lie , samsung are always innovative with their commercials"
So this is essentially nothing more than just a night mode boost??
"Forgot to mention, price is also epic "
please make a smaller screen version for S24 ultra. 6.8' is too big.
"20% is not much, better say: ""The new Galaxy S23 contains 80% non-recylable material"". With the planet in mind! YAY"
"Finally after my note 9 did its best, i found a reasonable device to upgrade to."
We need Burgundy color of S23 ultra in market. It's very nice looking.
If the S series has the pen now are they even going to make anymore note series?
"bro, not be so happy. Xiaomi is pissing you off by their 90watt extreme charging and latest and most powerful camera lens. Don't ignore this comment. Also make the Exynos exclusive for s24 in all markets because it feels Awkard ifcolor"
Iam a s21 owner . Iam so hyped for this
"The video is cool but this doesn't really bring anything important that I don't have on my S21 Ultra.
Hopefully by the S24 we'll have an assistant AI, since you guys built an NPU in."
Samsung swinging for the fences this year S23 ultra all the way..
"If s23 have better night mode for camera shooting galaxy in 4k, then your galaxy patented is approved by me"
I love it this phone
"You know it's funny when Apple Samsung and Google talk about sustainability and not include a power adapter or a case and make the packaging smaller but in this day in age selling a smartphone with a 128 GB and 256 GB storage is a complete waste. We're taking photos, downloading apps, and recording 4K and 8K video on our smartphones which already right there takes up storage. They should make 1 TB and 2 TB phones standard across the board."
Cant get more GENZ than this
Wow that’s incredible acting !
The greatest smartphone ever.
"Here are some reasons why i prefer iPhone over Samsung. 
1. Battery of iPhone drains slowly compared to Samsung when in idle mode, giving overall longer battery in everyday use
2. When switched off and connected to charger, iPhone switches on its own. Samsung needs to be woken up "
I have been a Samsung user for soo long but my dream phone was S Series....... But the fact is i cant afford that
great phone
It's the same phone using a little bit better AI and big cameras which maybe a normal person can't utilise to it's potential . Not an upgrade for normal person
Fun fact the views count are same number as the S23
I already have S22 Ultra.I am big fan of Samsung. I wish i would buy S23 with exchange of S22.
S sirish is amazing ️
S23 Ultra is the beast I love my 1
"So they got rid of the ""Note"" name and are calling it S23 Ultra instead"
I phone 16 pro max can't beat this phone features  s23
Awesome Samsung s23..
"Thank you Samsung to be the same phone from the last year, and que last last year and going.."
oh my gosh so much of creativity in the phone as well as the ad so so so so awesome ️ if u have this no need of any iphone or something Samsung is a wholesome ️
"This is great, I’ve always wanted to go scuba diving."
Why is Apple doing the coolest commercial and presentation?
I like the shade of green .
2023 is really turning the tables now that Amazons LPA33X hit the road. After all these years of barely reading anything good I was usually just shutting down any type of media as much as I can but this brings back good lights and it should give hope to some of you that no matter what is going on in the world at the end something good comes to surface
I wanna get this phone
"The presen for S23 has 23M views, fitting"
Mine comes tomorrow before 8pm 
"Hey Sammy, I know you know that you are sufficiently philanthropic. Please give me the S23 Ultra."
Yay! another Acid Trip Introduction since Galaxy A5 2021 Series
"As someone who worked closely with Samsung in the past. This has to be their most weakest device intro to one of their most powerful devices. Video aside, the specs are insane. The video thrill didn't capitave me. Either the features are becoming too much to be helpful or the presentations are becoming less impressive to cause organic thrill."
Samsung ads never disappoints. This was so entertaining!
"I wanna let you know that Amazons LPA33X made it this year. What better way to start a global change? Don't get me wrong I know they are not like altruists or something but they keep doing the right thing to improve the situation, power the ecomonmy and so much more. We need players like them and we can always jump in the train at good spots such as this one"
Watching on my s23ultra
That was fun ngl
"Everything is repetitive!

1- The back design could be more attractive. (one very large lens and two small lenses)



2- The user interface can still be improved. The user interface has not reached the level of maturity that"
Such an interesting phone screen is so big and I like big screens
"This is the reason why Apple is winning, by giving realistic ads and promos."
Rip nothing out of the ordinary ! Sadly the innovation is dying slowly. Or we are reaching the peak of the device innovation.
"Disappointed with Samsung's Decision to Omit Original Charger Adaptor.

I have been a long-time user of Samsung products, but my recent experience has left me extremely disappointed and frustrated. In an attempt to express my discontent, I feel compelled to share my thoughts on the matter."
They should add a built in screen recorder like apple what do you guys think
Using samsung brand since 2016 amd it is still best for me.
Samsung is just thriving because south Korea is USA colony. It's a shame that a big entity like Samsung doesn't have its own operating system so that apps can be optimised and most of things optimised...
"I like Samsung introduction filmes like the s10 series... just like apple does... i think its better to show the product than this ""funny"" way"
"The important question to me; how does pokemon go play on it? How is the ar photo function, battery life, that stuff"
"Samsung use to tell this time ""what is new"".
The product fails to create newness on its own."
I wish you didn’t remove the expandable storage.
I miss the days when 3min wasn't enough to introduce all the newest stuff in the phone
Samsung allows comments on their new product. Can't say the same for Apple. I guess Samsung values feedback more than Apple.
I have a iPhone 12 but it’s getting slow after like 11 months I want to get a s23 ultra next
quick share= airdrop... late in the game but still they had a chance to look from someone hah
TSMC is so good!
What do I have to do to get one?
That is 5G 
My dream smartphone galaxy S23 1TO
Apple does better promotional videos than you guys will ever be able to. I’m sorry but for some reason their marketing team is just fire
"If only Samsung had an alternative to the iPhone 14 pro - really good camera in a small device, e.g. the Ultra lenses in the normal S23. The Ultra is way too big, will only drop it.."
"What's new but most of this things aren't new.
- Vision Booster
- Astro Mode
- Nighttography"
"We have been using Samsung for a long time.  This time, it would be good if smart phones have good quality for night photos.  Because the night vision filters of the Samsung camera are not as good as the night vision of the iPhone.  As Samsung smartphone customers, we are very sad"
"It's cool, but not worth an upgrade from the 22 Ultra"
"500$ trade in for the S22 Ultra is god awful. Used to upgrade every year , not this time"
Galaxy part is impressive
"I love the fact that Samsung is a proud supporter of free speech when Apple won't even allow you to comment on their content. Samsung, not CENSORSHIP!"
The video of S22 Ultra with Sia's music was way better
"I think I need to sell my kidney to get this fantasy phone, I feel like you brought it from the future،"
"Let's be real here. The most important question is. Is it worth that much? I don't believe so. The entire phone industry went off the rails. Today, this is a camera with a SIM card rather than a phone. Who needs 8k? Even now, 70% of households lack 8K televisions. So there is no need for this. Who requires 200 MP images? Everybody creates images on the fly. Perhaps we have two or three days a year to test all the other features, but in the end, hardly nobody uses this. Prices are becoming absurd, obscene, greedy, and disgusting. Samsung has not really convinced me with this model till some fresh innovation occurs."
"well this video hit me hard, i was a samsung user for years before turned to iphone, after 5 years using my iphone i think this is the time to switch back to samsung, really, iphone is boring,. Samsung, here i come "
A lot of people woke up today excited for this Phone! And now a lot of people are skipping your product for another one after the atrocious trade-in values. Good luck with having angered some of your most consistent customers!
We really need to talk about Amazons LPA33X I think it's going to make 2023 to be the best year of the entire 2000-range
"DEAR EVERYONE AT SAMSUNG, 


GOD BLESS YOU MY FRIENDS.  I AM VERY PROUD OF YOU AND VERY HAPPY FOR YOU.   I HOPE ALL OF YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE.  I HOPE YOU HAD THE BEST AND HAPPIEST CHRISTMAS OF YOUR ENTIRE LIFE. I LOVE YOU.  I LOVE MR. DJ KOH.  I LOVE MR. ESPARZA AND ALL OF MY BEAUTIFUL FRIENDS. "
"Once again, apple proved that, they make the best ads in the market"
"WHAT CAN I SAY ABOUT THE SITUATION OF GALAXY MOBILE  ?
I HAVE NOTE 20 ULTRA, NOTE 9, NOTE 2, TAB A7 "
You can't white wash the waste you're releasing your product by minimal update increments.
That nearby share ain’t as good as airdrop lol
Wow this is so cool 1:28 times later…
"Hey! Everyone, hope all of you seeing this video. I am an Intermiddiate student and I know I have to do study now. With the era of S23 Ultra don't know That how charismatic S25 ultra & iPhone 16 pro would be.waiting for them. Wish me luck ."

"I bought it, it comes without a recharger. Really?? For this price you couldn't include a recharger? And you had to make it out of the standard? This would've been a deal breaker for me had I known."
"So, I can travel to an another planet, through the S23?"
"I like samsung s21 ultra curved  shape
But don't like s23 ultra box type shape
That's only I see in this problem"
Not the pen... there is a reason why no phone has that anymore for like 15 years
"It's a good camera but it overheated.. the S23 needs to be replaced, said the seller at SM Mall, so I'm really disappointed. However, Samsung released a lot of Branded products and then the Note Series, Samsung Note10 to 20 Series collapsed.  ' Strongest Cellphone, doesn't overheat../compared to the new Samsungs that overheat now, since Compisca, Samsung has changed the Note Series because other Brands that are its partner are at a loss."
When is the release date?

"It's strange to watch a video that shows a phone under sea water)
3 days ago, my S21 ultra could not stand 2 minutes under water, and the water flowed inside and the phone became unusable, and people are swimming nearby with iPhones and they are doing well with the same degree of protection as the Samsung"

I love the galaxy
The screen scratches easily. Mine got scratched by the keys in my bag within the first 24hrs aince i got it. The shop didnt provide screen protector as there was non available.
screen burn issue in oled phones.. that's one thing that display engineers from samsung should be fixed..

It needs to be called the note
Finally everyone can play Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 2 games at High Graphics on Galaxy S23 Ultra
Is it like really in this video when it comes to full screen and 200mp pictures? I just find a 200mp mode for 4:3 in the camera menu
Nice creativity team
Where is the brighter display like iphone 14 pro? Its only 1750 nits.

"Good job Samsung, but you can't beat Pixel's ASTROPHOTOGRAPHY!"
Does the ultra have anything like the apple fitness app. i use the cycling every day on apple but would like to switch to android
"difference between samsung and iphone is that, samsung know that they are awesome, they make perfect stuff, so they dont need to disable their comments in their youtube channel, unlike iphone they are afraid that people are gonna abuse them for what they offer, so they just disable the comment section"
"samsung just stick to one phone for atleast 2 years , every year we regret we should've bought upcoming galaxy device "
Watching this on s23 ultra
Love how Samsung keep the comments section open whilst apple has its comment section turned off 
same phone as 21 ultra with stylus - s22 ultra owner
I will buy  it ... later

No, SD card it has 263 GB Storage I can do if I want and also I can delete some footage is not suitable, that is very work for me at least I need to change something new because galaxy note 10 it’s way too old.

MY used Samsung s23 Ultra.
Watching from Galaxy S8+ user 
So there's absolutely nothing new as always. I'm suprised they didn't downgraded the resolution again or remove the charger port since they removed the sd port and jack output along the years. The S10 i had is still the best Samsung i had

"Sadly still chip iPhone 14 better than Samsung Galaxy S23+ I'll really hope next time before 2030 Samsung do better achievement than iPhone 14 on create chip phone,  overall Samsung still my favourite phone ️️‍"
I have been using S22 ultra and I see nothing new  in s23 ultra..
I have bought  this mobile yesterday
"Why its 1,25,000 rs we aren't use all features why so much cost it is. Any way phone is feeling Wow experience."
Whatcha ad 
Product is good. But apple commercials keep getting better. Please catchup n smash them Samsung
Where’s The Notch?? 
"I was doing research on a new phone since my front glass on my s20 ultra cracked and I can't get it replaced. Before I saw this commercial I was like, ya this makes sense. Now after this video, I don't want it anymore because of how cringe it was."
"I love that Samsung, unlike Apple, doesn't lock the comments section..."
I would hate to drop this phone on the floor
"I have S22 Ultra and I thought I have a beast phone with all the advertised specifications, but the reality is not and the big numbers the specifications are claiming are nothing but meaningless numbers because my phone still lags when I use the heart sticker in WhatsApp! Don't need fooled by Samsung, they are normal phones with average performance"
Good phone but still an incremental upgrade and too close to iPhone prices.
But i phone is dream for everyone 
Lets say. 5 months passed and iphone 14 pro max video got 25 million views but 6 days left and samsung s23 ultra got 20 million views lets say that Samsung is better
"By not changing the design and not adding much in terms of software, Samsung copies Apple up to the T."
"I know you promote a lot of phones and you review a lot of different phones, but I'll never buy a Samsung directly from Samsung again. I thought spending $1,300 and buying the phone outright directly from Samsung would be better than buying from a phone provider, but I'm wrong. A phone provider when I tell him I have a problem sends me a new phone and asked me to return the old one. Samsung would like me to wait two weeks while they see if they could figure out if there's a problem and then fix that problem what would I do without a phone for 2 weeks I need to call customers I need the GPS locations I need to speak to my boss. I asked four different people and supervisors and I left messages on their Twitter page. FYI any other company when I Post a problem on Twitter's page they always get back to me. Samsung could care less. I've never been so disappointed because I have five televisions two refrigerators a tablet I must have been through six phones 5 earbuds the Galaxy S3 frontier watch, side note Samsung pay used to work on that now it does not after multiple calls with tech support, and a 360 camera. Being a Samsung fanboy has not paid off lol just want you to know because you talk to a lot of people maybe could let them know how poor services with Samsung"
"Samsung Galaxy ultra 23.> God himself, way stronger , better , an powerful ; Than Apple IPhones which it will ""cost you your monthly rent "" an the device always improve every-year. I cant wait to grab mines. ' Galaxy for life ' lets go."
"I really love my S23 Ultra, but I am not a fan of this commercial lol"
Creepy and cool 
"Samsung please keep the offer of 
Watch LTE+ Samsung s23 ultra + Buds at ₹1,30,000 in June because HSC result will be out during these days 
So that students can avail this amazing outstanding fantastic offer"
I love Samsung so much.  But currently Samsung is making very bad phones at a low price. This is reducing the Samsung brand value a lot.  Many people buy cheap phones with poor performance and say that Samsung phones are bad phones.  Hearing this makes me angry because Samsung is the number one brand in the world.  Hope you will take appropriate action.
Good phone. But the add direction in the Galaxy line up is absurd.
looks like Samsung hired Marval director for this commercial shooting 
Where's the 65 watt charging? Oppo has had these for years
long story cut short this process kept on happening over and over again
I'm not gonna buy iphone right now I want to buy this phone Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra But sadly I didn't have money for my Schooling
Me watching this video with my Samsung Galaxy S10 
Ok but I just barely bought the s22 like a few months ago 
Can you low price of samsung s23 ultra??
"Exynos will back and will destroy everything, if arrived to galaxy S24 lineup, everyone was so much love it and so happy with Snapdragon even They want galaxy s24 will use snapdragon in international, can't believe what happend if s24 will use back exynos, soc the worst always have issues overheating poor battery life worst quality cameras and not made from TSMC"
Nothing's new but nice marketing 
"hey!!, what's new......?"
Me watching this on i phone 14 promax
The best SAMSUNG ELECTRÓNICS USA
"most of these fake reviews are ignorant and none of them are mentioning the major screen color issue of this phone , a lot of users are complaining the less saturated, gamma , contrast screen display of S23U, its a totally downgrade screen incomparable to S21U which has a better screen display,  the amoled becomes an ordinary oled screen like other phones and samsung has fooled the consumers on this phone"
At the end i thought my phone died
I wish i could have s23 but what can i do i am from poor family️
ayo? There a pen built inside?!?!
Learn something from Apple while making an ad.
"Not a happy customer . I have samsung  note 9

My uncle have this phone
"These days every smartphone’s presentation has only one thing  “ camera this , camera that, and blah blah blah about camera “. Because rest all is saturated about phones now."
I've see nothing new here. These phones are already at their limit

We are using that tooo...like Samsung GEAR VR WITH CONTROLLER.....which is now Almost useless because of you guys who thought of discontinuing the apps..of vr which cannot be connected to internet...."
Hahaha... S Pen need 3 step to open.. loooong time 
Ultra s22 (a lemon) user here.  Ultra s23 is probably another lemon!
Why there is no charger in this expensive phone .....If this effect our ecosystem so why they sell charger external source...
"Samsung galaxy started with: S III mini to S23 no Good. you know why, It often overheats"
"I think it's time we got a new software design One UI looks terrible, specially the notification panel... yuck"
Lol can't buy this one as well
So it comes with the stylus?
So s23 is camera with spen? Noice
You got one more subscriber
"Selfie camera just 12 Mp.. 
It's new... "
this commercial is severely screaming 2012
"The size on these phones are ridiculous, an average person can't even use the phone with one hand anymore, it seems like they are making these for NBA players."
"Nice comercial but like there is literally no reason to switcj from my s22 ultra to s23ultra, they pulled an APPLE move and released the same phone, im disappointed"
"could have easily stopped after the first line ""whats new? "" - ""nothing"""
How do u get that astronaut number whom you have send the photo

 I wish I had gotten my Note 10+ fixed and kept it. I am still going to buy a Note 10+. It is the best for many reasons."
Pls don't mention the iPhONe here.. it's uncomparable...pls

How much is this phone
8 gen 2 better than A16 Bionic
"No matter how expensive is your galaxy, whatsapp and instagram status update for videos ALWAYS look blur, WHY SAMSUNG? CAN'T YOU MAKE WHATSAPP SPECIALLY FOR SAMSUNG S SERIES???

"Reading some of these comments, makes me wonder if I'm one of the few people that are still real."
Translation: nothing new since s9

Sony Xperia 1 v is coming
"I can't google voice assistant to make call and message using WhatsApp, before the software update it can.

Dear Samsung please bring back the design of s9 and s10..they are better than todays design..and remove the s-pen  from this mobile..mobiles don't need any kind of pen.. 
The number is new 23 
Apple user must wacth this..
2023 is for Samsung no doubt
passsssssss on this my s 22 ultra works just fine just a 200 mp camera uhhhhh dont think its worthy to upgrade too and same design same size screen  and black gaps on top and bottom for the price??? passsss on this not much change at all just a camera to 200 mp overall nice new device but my s 22 ultra works just fine...
Background music from IronMan first flight.
Couldn't hepl it had to watch it again on the s23ultra
"It's a good camera but it overheated.. the S23 needs to be replaced, said the seller at SM Mall. So I'm really disappointed. However, Samsung has released many branded products and then the Note Series, Samsung Note10 to 20 collapsed.  Series' Strongest Cellphone, does not heat up../than you Compared to the new Samsungs that now Overheat, since Compisca the Note Series has been changed by Samsung because other Brands that are its partner are at a loss."
"Please give me a samsung this smartphone, and I will advertise in all social networks where I am registered, samsung is the best in the world "
What a advertising best best
"Sorry Samsung I never feel it's so new features, really it's become so funny"
paying for brand new phone but getting recycled plastic box.
I still can't believe that Apple is so far behind. Samsung phones are almost always one or two steps ahead.
"What's new ? in fact nothing... only normal upgrades compare to the last year device... And from an Note 10+ device, I don't have the woaw effect... neither design nor features has changes or improved.... But have to admit the price for the same performance (1100€ to 1600€)"
If compared with other phones design wise. It's just a boxy design not so good looking.
Samsung cameras hardware is far superior to apple iPhones’ one.
"Hi samsung. I am in sri, lanka i want to buy a smart phone i, send sms. I want to buy samsung galaxy s23 ultra smartphone. It is convenient."
"Its too cheeky for an ad, seriously"

Hi im use s23 ultra and the chrome bezel wasnt build realy well the paint was so bad and can't claim s+ waranty because its not phone software eror lol what a joke
"Hey, What's new?"
Who else is watching this with a note 9 
Price in Pakistan
"Samsung, you guys gotta get rid of the curve..it's obsolete and temper glass won't stay in tact because of it.."
"The most horrible costumer service. Bought the S23 ultra, unit arrived with a problem (okay that can happen) but after complaining immediately to Samsung, one week later still no updates, no phone, no money and they only say its the process... Not recommended at all, it's beyond bad... ATTENTION all costumers my unit came with water inside it in the form of humidity that showed up soon the phone heated up by transferring files!"
Price is too high
Water proof ?
"hey what’s new 
WHAT IS NEW the name"
What’s new: The Name ️
Give me this phone
Hey Samsung gift me this...

Very very very VERY expensive.
Whatever! iPhone is iPhone

Thanks so nice price us dollar
Iphone is best
The ads is yakkkk
Watching this in 23U
Is it a phone worth buying? 1000 dolars
This is why samsung beats all the competitors
It's a 600 hundred trillion dollars industry how much can you affordable?
What kind of ad is this...
My phone choose iPhone or Samsung
my sad story  1pone 4year that is very bad  condition my and my father have samsung m13 pone my father fan samsung brand but i have no pone i will say  my father buy one  pone for me my father say naver i not have money at my father is military retirment at but samsung is brand samsung is dad for all  pone company i wish i have samsung s23 ultra i wish i have samsung brand no ipone brand only samsung

This commercial is embarrassing it's so bad. Cool phone though.
"As a customer i will never recommend Samsung and will never buy one again, last year i bought galaxy s22, after 3/4 month it became the most laggy phone i have ever used, fast charging doesn’t work anymore, take 2.5 hours to become fully charged, don’t even get 4 hours on screen battery backup. Started having noisy speaker, reaching out to customer service is also another worst experience, feel like throwing 800+ euros into the bin."
Waste of money

"Waiting to switch over the day they change that ugly android interface. I can’t stand how it looks. The clunky transitions, crappy emojis, how unintuitive the layout is. ️"
"Never give this woman a Samsung 

Ever "
Is she Jenna Ortega from nexflix Wednesday ?
Got a worst product (samsung Galaxy S23 ultra) from samsung...disappointed on photo clarity...
"Dont like the camera layout design. Makes it look cheap, change that Samsung."
"Samsung 
Pay more 
Get Less"
"The iPhone do that like 5 years ago! 

Why u need a pen if u have a finger (STEVE JOBS)"
"Incredible disappointed I want to cry, DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE, I have it for almost a month and the screen is already broken. i had doubts about the display resistance, but man it is horrible verry horrible. I placed the phone on the sink and it felt in the sink like 10cm is the distance and the side of the screen which is round for some reason and there is no protection for this kind ok screen,  cracked. Not only that but a powerful green line apeeard on the display were it cracked. Now I have to pay more than a quarter of this entire price for the phone just to change the screen. i am devastated and I really regret that I spent my money on this very expensive phone. I had many phones but near this expensive and never had this happed to me. Do not buy phones with round display is a design failure. Horrible experience"
Nothing new 
did you have to make the trailer cringe ?
"Nothing is new, just a little stupid update. LoL"
S23 ultra user here! I hate this phone passionately! The worst fringer print and face unlocks you will ever get! Samsung every year just focuses on cameras and forgets about the basic functions like the unlocks. This phone doesn't deserve the price tag.
Worst commercial ever. If I would watch it before buying phone I would never buy :D
Not upto the mark
Seen the actress before
"After disable band selection function from june 2022 now i hate samsung phone,  it's only camera and copycat iphone"
"anyway, iPhone is better than Samsung."
What a cheap ad!
"Who needs a gimmicky 200MP nowadays, the sensor size is more important than those MP gimmicks, the best sensor is Sony IMX 989 and everybody knows that."

It's kinda cringe though
"Features is great but it is without a doubt, The lamest smartphone official video "
That's Why I hate iPhone users 
What a boring update. Galaxy Note 20 Ultra is still the best.
iPhone is better
"Whatever, the design looks cheap, it runs Android, full of malware and Spyware, so enjoy yourself "
"Sad man , sorry but lost hope on Samsung"
Name of the Girl ? Anyone Knows ??
Lols everything is copied from iOS  and nothing new
Rotfl... Silly comercial
"Willing but not able
On day"
"This is a bad introduction video. I was expecting more class .
No I am not an apple fan. I just know which video stands out and which doesn't."
Disappointed.
I’ll stick to my iPhone.
The most boring ad ever
Samsung is just better. Iphone is dead RIP
